# NDT

A simple, efficient tool to help diagnose network-related issues when playing Valorant. It performs basic network analysis, such as ping checks and routing tests, and outputs the results to a ZIP folder for easy sharing. This tool is especially helpful when people are posting on Valorant forums such as discord about network problems, as it quickly gathers all the critical network data needed for troubleshooting.
